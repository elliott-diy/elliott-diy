# Hi, I'm Elliott

I'm a computer security student who builds random tools, scanners, CTF challenges, and whatever else seems fun to break or automate. Most of it starts as a dumb idea and ends up being useful. I care about privacy, weird edge cases, and figuring out how stuff works by messing with it.
